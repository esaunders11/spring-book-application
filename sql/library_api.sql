Throughout the authors asked: \"\"What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?\"\" What separates General Electric 3M Merck Wal-Mart Hewlett-Packard Walt Disney and Philip Morris from their rivals? How for example did Procter & Gamble which began life substantially behind rival Colgate eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry?

How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the world\'s best commercial aircraft company -- what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked?

Ulysses S. Grant was the first officer since George Washington to become a fourâ€“star general in the United States Army and the only president between Andrew Jackson and Woodrow Wilson to serve eight consecutive years in the White House. In this succinct and vivid biography Michael Korda considers Grant\'s character and reconciles the conflicting evaluations of his leadership abilities. Grant\'s life played out as a true Horatio Alger story. Despite his humble background as the son of a tanner in Ohio his lack of early success in the army and assorted failed business ventures his unwavering determination propelled him through the ranks of military leadership and into the presidency.

Assessing Grant both within the context of his time and in contrast to more recent American leaders Korda casts a benevolent eye on Grant\'s presidency while at the same time conceding his weaknesses. He suggests that though the general\'s second term ended in financial and political scandals the fact remains that for eight years Grant exerted a calming influence on a country that had only just emerged from a horrendous civil war.

Situating Jefferson within the context of America\'s evolution and tracing his legacy over the past two hundred years Hitchens brings the character of Jefferson to life as a man of his time and also as a symbolic figure beyond it. Conflicted by power Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and acted as Minister to France yet yearned for a quieter career in the Virginia legislature. Predicting that slavery would shape the future of America\'s development this professed proponent of emancipation elided the issue in the Declaration and continued to own human property. An eloquent writer he was an awkward public speaker; a reluctant candidate he left an indelible presidential legacy. Jefferson\'s statesmanship enabled him to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase with France doubling the size of the nation and he authorized the Lewis and Clark expedition opening up the American frontier for exploration and settlement. Hitchens also analyzes Jefferson\'s handling of the Barbary War a lesser-known chapter of his political career when his attempt to end the kidnapping and bribery of Americans by the Barbary states and the subsequent war with Tripoli led to the building of the U.S. navy and the fortification of America\'s reputation regarding national defense.

Many mistakenly believe there are no choices other than fundamentalism or simply rejecting the Bible as something that can bring meaning to our lives. Answering this modern dilemma acclaimed author Marcus Borg reveals how it is possible to reconcile the Bible with both a scientific and critical way of thinking and our deepest spiritual needs leading to a contemporary yet grounded experience of the sacred texts. This seminal book shows you how to read the Bible as it should be examinedâ€”in an approach the author calls \"historical-metaphorical.\"\" Borg explores what the Scriptures meant to the ancient communities that produced and lived by them. He then helps us to discover the meaning of these stories providing the knowledge and perspective to make the wisdom of the Bible an essential part of our modern lives. The author argues that the conventional way of seeing the Bible\'s origin authority and interpretation has become unpersuasive to millions of people in our time and that we need a fresh way of encountering the Bible that takes the texts seriously but not literally even as it takes seriously who we have become. Borg traces his personal spiritual journey describing for readers how he moved from an unquestioning childhood belief in the biblical stories to a more powerful and dynamic relationship with the Bible as a sacred text brimming with meaning and guidance. Using his own experience as an example he reveals how the modern crisis of faith is itself rooted in the misinterpretation of sacred texts as historical record and divine dictation and opens readers to a truer more abundant perspective. This unique book invites everyoneâ€”whatever one\'s religious backgroundâ€”to engage the Bible wrestle with its meaning explore its mysteries and understand its relevance.

How did queens find happiness? In courts bristling with testosteroneâ€”swashbuckling generals polished courtiers and virile cardinalsâ€”many royal women had love affairs. Anne Boleyn flirted with courtiers; Catherine Howard slept with one. Henry VIII had both of them beheaded. Catherine the Great had her idiot husband murdered and ruled the Russian empire with a long list of sexy young favorites. Marie Antoinette fell in love with the handsome Swedish count Axel Fersen who tried valiantly to rescue her from the guillotine. Empress Alexandra of Russia found emotional solace in the mad monk Rasputin. Her behavior was the spark that set off the firestorm of the Russian revolution. Princess Diana gave up her palace bodyguard to enjoy countless love affairs which tragically led to her early death. When a queen became sick to death of her husband and took a lover anything could happenâ€”from disgrace and death to political victory. Some kings imprisoned erring wives for life; other monarchs obligingly named the queen\'s lover prime minister. The crucial factor deciding the fate of an unfaithful queen was the love affair\'s implications in terms of power money and factional rivalry. At European courts it was the politicsâ€”not the sexâ€”that caused a royal woman\'s tragedyâ€”or her ultimate triumph.','Sex with the Queen',3.91,'History','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5GSgQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',2006),(298,259,'Aldous Huxley',9780060000000,'Huxley\'s classic prophetic novel describes the socialized horrors of a futuristic utopia devoid of individual freedom.','Brave New World',3.98,'Fiction','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V4kY9WSCgSwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',2006),(299,309,'Meg Cabot',9780060000000,'Lizzie Nichols discovers that her inability to keep her mouth shut has landed her once again in hot water when she aggravates her unfaithful boyfriend Andy is stranded in London and takes a job as a bartender for a catered wedding at a French chateau an affair that ends with the groom in disgrace a furious bride and Andy returning to ruin everything. 100000 first printing.','Queen of Babble',3.69,'Fiction','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KM1a1gyldeAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',2006),(300,370,'Barbara Kingsolver;Camille Kingsolver;Steven L.
